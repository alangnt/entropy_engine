struct allows to group related data together, like a Class.

## Newton's law
$F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$
with **r** being the distance between particle A and B 

## To calculate the distance between two particles in a 3D space, we use the 3D Pythagorean theorem
$distance = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}$
