struct allows to group related data together, like a Class.

## Newton's law
$F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$
with **r** being the distance between particle A and B 

## To calculate the distance between two particles in a 3D space, we use the 3D Pythagorean theorem
$distance = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}$
with G = 6.67430e-11

## To calculate the acceleration of the object being pulled, we use Newton's second law
$$a = \frac{F}{m}$$

## The to calculate the velocity at an instant t
$$v_{new} = v_{old} + (a \cdot dt)$$ with dt being the amount of time that has passed since the last calculation
